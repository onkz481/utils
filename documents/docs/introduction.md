# Introduction

This document provides an overview of currently implemented packages, installation methods, sample code, and more.

## What is this?

When creating JS libraries etc., there are library-independent, frequently used processes.
For example, a conditional expression using the `typeof` operator, a regular expression that matches a URL, and so on.

These are relatively easy to implement and can be prepared on a project-by-project basis.
However, if you are considering maintenance, it may be useful to manage it in a separate package.

This library classifies such functions and variables and provides them as packages.
